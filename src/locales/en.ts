    minhaJornadaTitle: "My Journey",
    minhaJornadaP1: "Hi, I'm Thiago Di Faria. A software developer from Belo Horizonte, focused on backend. My journey in technology began with a pragmatic choice. While my interests fluctuated around architecture and the combination of art and history, I made a conscious and ambitious decision to pursue technology, recognizing the growth potential and opportunities to build a solid career. What started as an objective career decision, however, soon became a field of genuine fascination, where I found a new kind of creativity in solving complex problems.",
    minhaJornadaP2: "It all started in 2023 with Harvard's \"CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python\" course. I was amazed not only by the language but by the infinite creative capabilities and versatility it offers. This potential led me to seek formal education, and after a brief stint in Information Systems, I switched in August 2024 to Systems Analysis and Development at PUC Minas, a more practical and direct path.",
    minhaJornadaP3: "In early 2025, I had the opportunity that defined my focus: I was the lead developer of a complete desktop CRM application, built entirely in Python. This immersive experience taught me about responsibility, autonomy, and above all, made me discover that although I admired the frontend, it was behind the scenes, in the logic and data structuring of the backend, that I truly felt at home.",
    minhaJornadaP4: "This affinity drives me to create. Since then, I have invested in my portfolio with projects such as developing my own API for sentiment analysis, creating a financial analysis system with real market data, and even a foray into frontend to bring to life a website inspired by a wine magazine.",
    minhaJornadaP5: "I take great pride in my roots and my state, Minas Gerais: its unmistakable cuisine, its rich history of struggle, and unique culture enchant me. Among my diverse ancestries, the Italian one is the most special. I feel connected to its language, customs, and the way this culture intertwined with Brazilian culture, especially here in Minas. Whether through the significant influence on gastronomy or the cultural impact, I see this heritage as part of my identity. Outside the world of code, I am a sports enthusiast. My favorites are MMA and football. In MMA, I'm a big fan of Georges St-Pierre (GSP), and in football, like a good 'mineiro', I'm a registered fan of Galo. I also closely follow Formula 1, with admiration for drivers like Sebastian Vettel and, of course, Ayrton Senna. My musical taste is eclectic and reflects my different phases, ranging from Kanye West, Henrique & Juliano, WS da Igrejinha, Duke Dumont, and Deftones.",
    minhaJornadaP6: "Feel free to explore my portfolio, get to know my projects, and get in touch. I am always open to new challenges and partnerships.",
